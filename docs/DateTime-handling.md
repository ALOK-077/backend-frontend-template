# Overview
- Backend sends all data in UTC, and accepts data in LOCAL client timezones.
- The frontend MUST send dates to backend in local client timezone (i.e. no conversion to UTC should be made on the frontend) and should specify this timezone.
- Database - all values are in UTC.
- Backend - all values are in UTC.
- Client - all values are in LOCAL timezone (converted from UTC automatically on deserialization. when serializing - no conversion to UTC is made).

**We only use DateTime class on backend (never use DateTimeOffset).**

This aligns with recommendations https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/2209#issuecomment-434823765
>Working with timezone-aware databases is a headache. Whenever possible, we recommend that users go ~~turtles~~ UTC all the way down. That is, only convert from/to local time when displaying to a human user.

# TL/DR
- Use `DateOnly` if you want to store only the dates (independent of the TimeZone).
- Use `DateTime` if you want to store Date with Time. It will be always in UTC on backend.
- Never use `DateTimeOffset`.



# Handling DateTime (with time)

- Client need to send the datetime using local timezone, i.e. `2021-01-23T17:30:00+07:00` should be sent over http.
- Backend upon deserialization will convert the date to UTC. I.e. on backend it will be `2021-01-23T10:30:00`. Since we use `DateTime` (not `DateTimeOffset`) no timezone is specified. All values on backend are in UTC.
- In GET requests the server sends values in UTC, i.e. the following will be sent: `2021-01-23T10:30:00+00:00`. Client will know it's UTC (by the trailing `+00:00`) and will convert it to local time, `2021-01-23T17:30:00+07:00`.

# Handling DateOnly (without time)
If certain property contains only Date (without time), e.g. `BirthDate`, it must be of `DateOnly` type.
In this case everything is handled automatically (by `DateOnlyConverter`s and autogenerated clients).
`DateOnly` fields are serialized as `yyyy-MM-dd` (both from Frontend and Backend side).


# Handling DateTimeOffset
We do NOT use DateTimeOffset at all.

### Rationale
PostgreSQL doesn't store timezone offset, and Npgsql requires that all DateTimeOffset have Zero offset (otherwise it throws an exception upon saving).
So, if you always have to use Zero offset, using `DateTimeOffset` type doesn't make any sense and only brings confusion (because it seems like you could use different time zones, while in reality you could not).
