# How to set up and use GitLab free Container Registry for build pipelines

1. Register a user in GitLab (using project email)
    - even if you plan to use Groups you have to create a dedicated account for this project for creating AccessTokens. Gitlab doesn't allow to create tokens scoped to a single project (it creates tokens per user). So, you have to create dedicated user for a project.

1. Create a personal access token with read/write access to container registry
